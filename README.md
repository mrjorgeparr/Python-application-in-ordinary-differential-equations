The objective is to handle all possible solutions that may arise from the following equation:
  - mu''(t) + cu'(t) + ku(t) = âˆ’mg

Which is the equation that describes the front shock-absorber based on a spring-dashpot system of a 
typical mountain bike, u(t) is the distorsion with respect to the equilibrium point of the aforementioned
spring.
